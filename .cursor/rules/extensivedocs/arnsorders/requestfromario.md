thanks for submitting your updated grant proposal for the ArNS Marketplace.

@JonnieSparkles and I sat down with @Vilenarios and @dylan (dtf) | ar.io yesterday to review your proposal and some  feedback for you ðŸ™Œ 

Positives
Existing platform with distribution that ArNS fits into nicely to complement each other
We know you guys well, we know your know AO/ArNS and we enjoy working with
Well thought our proposal!

Thoughts/feedback
We noticed your proposal talks about wrapping ANT tokens as Atomic assets and creating AO processes for tracking ArNS ownership in user profiles. We're ideally looking for a solution here that is interoperable and not tightly coupled to a specific implementation - the ANTs, their handles and registry were designed in such a way to support this kind of approach. We're in theory fine with ARNS/ANTS being compatible with UCM/profiles but we'd like to avoid them being dependant on them.

Could you share some more info re your current approach (e.g. why wrapping ANTs as atomic assets vs just using ANTs) and coupling them with profiles? A state diagram showing the flow of an order would be hflpful for us to visualise it.

Also would like you perspective on updating the approach to lean into using the native features in ANTs, their handkers and registry - handling the order book/flow as a seperate process makes sense as this doesn't excist yet but wrapping as Atomic assets and coupling to profiles less so.

Hope that makes sense - @dylan (dtf) | ar.io can likely provide some more clarity on this feedback.
