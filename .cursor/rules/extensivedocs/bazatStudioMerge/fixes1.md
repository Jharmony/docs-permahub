2. Cover Art Upload Interface - Professional drag & drop component
3. Base64 Processing - Converts images for storage
4. Validation - File type and size checking
5. Asset Linking - Creates proper relationships on Arweave
6. State Management - Integrated with Redux

Files Modified (Only Our Changes)

•  ✅ src/helpers/config.ts - Added model content type
