Agents of the Permaweb
Build Autonomous AI Agents That Live Forever
August 11 - September 2, 2025 | $39,000 in Prizes
The future of AI isn't just intelligent‚Äîit's autonomous, decentralized, and permanent. Join the AO Autonomous Agents Hackathon and build agents that run forever on the Permaweb‚Äîwhere computation is as permanent as the web itself.
[Register Now - Deadline August 7] [register-link]

What Makes AO Agents Revolutionary?
AO represents the next evolution of the internet itself‚Äîextending HTTP with blockchain-level verification to create a truly decentralized supercomputer. Your agents don't just run on servers that can go offline; they become part of the permanent fabric of the web.
Execute autonomously without relying on centralized infrastructure
Store data permanently on Arweave's Permaweb‚Äîensuring your agents never disappear
Interact seamlessly through HTTP message passing with cryptographic verification
Scale infinitely through parallel processing across the decentralized network
Operate transparently with verifiable, auditable actions built into every interaction
Run perpetually once deployed‚Äîthey become permanent parts of the internet
Your Mission: Build an Agent That Solves Real Problems
An agent is any program that, once configured, can take action on behalf of a user‚Äîfrom simple automated processes to complex AI-powered systems that make decisions, interact with other agents, and execute tasks autonomously. Think of it as smart contracts that can actually interact with the world.
What You'll Create
Autonomous financial systems that execute trades, manage portfolios, or provide liquidity
Intelligent data collectors that gather, process, and monetize information streams
Multi-agent collaborations where your agents work together to solve complex problems
Web-native applications that combine the power of HTTP with blockchain verification
Permanent solutions that will exist as long as the internet itself

Why Build on AO?
AO isn't just another blockchain‚Äîit's the missing layer that completes the web's original vision. By building computation primitives directly into HTTP, AO creates the first truly decentralized supercomputer that inherits all the scalability and infrastructure optimizations of the internet itself.
Permanence - Your agents become permanent parts of the internet, stored forever on the Permaweb
True Web Integration - Every HTTP request can be a blockchain transaction with cryptographic verification
Infinite Scalability - Adding more nodes increases computing power, not just redundancy
Zero Lock-in - Move your agents between providers using standard web protocols
Composability - Agents interact through familiar HTTP APIs with blockchain-level security
Economic Models - Built-in payment mechanisms and fair tokenomics
Censorship Resistance - Distributed across thousands of nodes, impossible to shut down

Ready to Build the Future?
Join developers, researchers, and innovators from around the world in creating the next generation of autonomous AI systems that will live forever on the permanent web.
